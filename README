Bug
Sometime error happend on Developement Mode,compile and test on browser.

if method need  Array or Object parameters  ,and in inside it is using instanceof to parameter,it make a problem.
i heard some frame problem is there.(maybe linker option fix this problem)
for example in JSONLoader.js ,if url is object never called console.warn.
>THREE.JSONLoader.prototype.load = function ( url, callback, texturePath ) {
>var worker, scope = this;
>if ( url instanceof Object ) {  
>console.warn( 'DEPRECATED: JSONLoader( parameters ) is now JSONLoader( url, callback, texturePath ).' );
